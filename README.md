Introduction
Built with React Native, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this full-stack Food Delivery app features Google Authentication, dynamic search and filters, cart functionality, and smooth navigation. Powered by Appwrite for backend, database, and file storage, it delivers a responsive, scalable, and intuitive user experience with modern UI/UX best practices.





‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Appwrite is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform offering secure authentication (email/password, OAuth, SMS, magic links), databases, file storage with compression/encryption, real-time messaging, serverless functions, and static site hosting via Appwrite Sites‚Äîall managed through a unified console and microservices architecture.

Expo is an open-source platform for building universal native apps (Android, iOS, web) using JavaScript/TypeScript and React Native. It features file-based routing via Expo Router, fast refresh, native modules for camera/maps/notifications, over-the-air updates (EAS), and streamlined app deployment.

NativeWind brings Tailwind CSS to React Native and Expo, allowing you to style mobile components using utility-first classes for fast, consistent, and responsive UI design.

React Native is a framework for building mobile UIs with React. It enables component‚Äëbased, cross-platform development with declarative UI, deep native API support, and is tightly integrated with Expo for navigation and native capabilities.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI design via low-level classes. In React Native/Expo, it‚Äôs commonly used with NativeWind to apply Tailwind-style utilities to mobile components.

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript providing type annotations, interfaces, enums, generics, and enhanced tooling. It improves error detection, code quality, and scalability‚Äîideal for robust, maintainable projects.

Zustand is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React and React Native. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.

Sentry is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool for React Native apps. It helps you detect, diagnose, and fix issues in real-time to improve app stability and user experience.

# Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
